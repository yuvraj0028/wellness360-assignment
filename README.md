- **Postman**: API testing tool to interact with the endpoints and test requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that the following are installed:

1. **Java 21** - [Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. **Gradle 8** - [Download Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/).

3. **Postman** - [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## Running the Spring Boot Application

Once Java, Gradle, and Postman are installed, open your terminal follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvraj0028/wellness360-assignment.git
```

2. Change your directory:

```bash
cd wellness360-assignment
```

3. Build the application:

```bash
gradlew build
```

5. Run tests (optional but recommended):
```bash
gradlew test
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
gradlew bootRun
```

## Application Port
The application runs on port 9094. To access the APIs, use the base URL:
http://localhost:9094/api/v1.

## Steps to Get Authorization
1. Use the endpoint `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/auth/signup` to sign up and get an authentication token.
2. If you are already logged in but do not have the auth token, use the endpoint `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/auth/login`.

## Request Body for Signup and Login:

#### Request Body for Signup and Login:

```json
{
    "email": "user@test.com",
    "password": "User@123"
}
```

### IMPORTANT:
Once you have the token, it is mandatory to set the Bearer token in Postman for every API call other than the signup and login endpoints.

#### Postman Steps:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad9e47a6-0ad5-4536-a1fd-9bed7cfdbc71)
- Open Postman
- Go to the Authorization tab
- Select **Bearer** Token
- Paste the token in the provided field.

## API Endpoints
1. **Get all tasks**:
**GET** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks`
Fetch all tasks in the system.

2. **Get Task by ID**:
**GET** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks/{id}`
Fetch a task by its **ID** (ID is required).

3. **Create Task**:
**POST** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks`
Create a new task.
Request Body:
#### Request Body:
```json
{
    "title": "task",
    "description": "description",
    "dueDate": "28-11-2024"
}
```
The **dueDate** must be in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`. The default status of the task is `PENDING`.

4. **Update Task by ID**:
**PUT** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks/{id}`
Update a task by its **ID**.
Request Body:
```json
{
    "title": "task",
    "description": "description",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "dueDate": "28-11-2024"
}
```
**Status** should be one of the following: `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `COMPLETED`.

5. **Delete Task by ID**:
**DELETE** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks/{id}`
Delete a task by its **ID**.

6. **Mark Task as Completed**:
**PUT** `http://localhost:9094/api/v1/tasks/{id}/complete`
Mark a task as completed. **ID** is required.

## Exception Handling
The application includes a global exception handler to manage errors gracefully. It provides meaningful responses with HTTP status codes, ensuring users can easily understand issues when interacting with the API.

## Validation Logic
The service ensures that all inputs, such as task details and dates, are validated before processing. This prevents incorrect or incomplete data from being stored and ensures business rules are followed.

## Error Handling & Logging
Comprehensive error handling ensures that all errors are caught and logged, providing detailed information for debugging and operational insights. The logging follows best practices to capture key events, errors, and other important information.
